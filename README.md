# 2DStories

## Description

At 15, I built this web portfolio to showcase my passion for photography. It featured some of my early work, capturing a variety of subjects and experimenting with composition, lighting, and editing.
This project marked the beginning of my creative journey behind the lens, highlighting my growing interest in visual storytelling.
